# Flourish And Blotts

## We have all kinds of books for wizards and witches

## Buy or Visit our [Shop](https://flourish-and-blotts.web.app)

### We are now Owl Delivering all over the world.

### This is my first full stack project. I added following feature here-

- Loaded products data from Mongodb server
- Added Cart button to add product on user cart
- Checkout page to add product to Order list
- User Specific order list
- Google User authentication (login method)
- Admin page to manage product
- Create and delete product item from database for Admin
- Responsive layout (Not so cool though)

### Feature I wanted to add but can't add in time-

- Edit Product item for admin
- Delete product from order list
- Authenctic admin User
- Little better UI

### Wish to improve this after getting this assignment mark.

Thanks for reading. May The Almighty Bless us all.
